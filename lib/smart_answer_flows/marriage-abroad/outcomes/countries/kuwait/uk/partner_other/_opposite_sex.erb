Contact the [Embassy of Kuwait](/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk) before making any plans to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Kuwait](/foreign-travel-advice/kuwait) before making any plans.

You can have an Islamic or Christian marriage.

##Islamic marriages

What you need to do depends on your gender.

###If you are a Muslim man

You can marry a Muslim or non-Muslim woman.

Contact the [Kuwait Ministry of Justice](https://www.moj.gov.kw/en/Pages/default.aspx) to discuss the local marriage process.

You do not need a certificate of no impediment (CNI).

###If you are a Muslim woman

You cannot marry a non-Muslim man.

If your father is in Kuwait, you do not need a certificate of no impediment (CNI).

If your father is not in Kuwait, you’ll need his written consent. If you cannot get written consent you’ll need:

- written consent from a deputy - this could be someone [appointed as his attorney](/lasting-power-attorney-duties) or a judge in Kuwait
- your father’s death certificate if he is deceased

You may be able to use a certificate of no impediment (CNI) issued and legalised in the UK. Check with the [Kuwait Ministry of Justice](https://www.moj.gov.kw/en/Pages/default.aspx) to see if it can be used in place of written consent. 

You need to get your written consent and CNI translated into Arabic. You also need to get them ‘legalised’ (certified as genuine) by:

- the [Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO)](/get-document-legalised)
- the Kuwait Embassy in London
- the Kuwait Ministry of Foreign Affairs 

If your partner is not British, you should check with their embassy and the [Kuwait Ministry of Justice](https://www.moj.gov.kw/en/Pages/default.aspx) if any other documents are needed.

##Christian marriages 

At the Notary Department of [Kuwait Ministry of Justice](https://www.moj.gov.kw/en/Pages/default.aspx), you’ll need to provide either:

- a CNI issued in the UK
- a ’singleness certificate’ issued by the church you’re getting married at in Kuwait

Check with the Kuwait Ministry of Justice if any other documents are needed.

Documents in English need to be translated into Arabic and authenticated by the Kuwait Ministry of Justice.

###What you need to do

You need to submit your CNI or ‘singleness certificate’ to the notary department at the Kuwait Ministry of Justice within a week of it being issued.

You will need 2 witnesses (they must be Muslim or Christian men).

You, your partner and witnesses need to bring the original and copies of your Kuwait Civil ID if you live in Kuwait or your tourist visa if you’re visiting.

##Get a certificate of no impediment (CNI)

You can normally get a CNI by giving a notice of marriage at your local register office or registrar in the UK. Find your local office or registrar in [England and Wales](https://www.gov.uk/register-offices), [Scotland](http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files/registration/reglist.pdf), [Northern Ireland](http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/government-citizens-and-rights/births-and-registration/district-registrars-in-northern-ireland.htm), [Isle of Man](http://www.gov.im/registries/general/civilregistry), [Jersey](http://www.gov.je/pages/contacts.aspx?contactId=71) or [Guernsey](http://www.guernseyroyalcourt.gg/article/1663/Contact-Us).

^A CNI issued in Scotland is valid for 3 months. A CNI issued in England, Wales or Northern Ireland will not expire. Check with your local register office to find out how long a CNI is valid if you live in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. You should also check with the local authorities in Kuwait to find out how long a CNI is valid under local law.^

###Legalisation and translation

Your CNI needs to be translated into Arabic. You also need to it ‘legalised’ (certified as genuine) by:

- the [Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO)](/get-document-legalised)
- the Kuwait Embassy in London
- the Kuwait Ministry of Foreign Affairs 


You should also check with the local authorities in Kuwait to find out if you need to provide legalised and translated copies of any other documents.

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (for example marriage certificate or deed poll).%

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
